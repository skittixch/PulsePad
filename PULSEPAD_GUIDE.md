# Pulsepad: The No-Bullshit Guide

Pulsepad is a tactile, pattern-based sequencer designed for rapid sketching and modular sound design.

## Core Features
- **Pattern-Based Sequencing**: 16-step grid for drums and melody.
- **Multitrack Arrangement**: Independent track lengths and looping parts.
- **Modular FX Graph**: Visual routing of audio through filters, delays, distortion, and compressors.
- **Interactive Pitch System**: Pattern-specific scales with auto-inheritance for melodic consistency.
- **Sustained Previews**: Click and hold any note or interact with the grid to hear real-time audio feedback.

## Hotkeys
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Play / Stop (Always restarts from Step 1) |
| `V` | **Pointer Tool**: Standard selection and movement. |
| `C` | **Razor Tool**: Click notes to split them at the grid. |
| `Z` (Hold) | **Scale Pie Menu**: Quick scale selection at mouse position. |
| `Mouse Wheel` | **Shift Octave**: While dragging/resizing notes to change pitch. |
| `Ctrl + C / V` | Copy and Paste patterns. |
| `Ctrl + Z / Y` | Undo / Redo. |
| `Del / Backspace`| Delete selected notes. |
| `Middle-Click` | Delete parts in Arrangement View. |
| `Right-Click` | Toggle Loop mode for parts in Arrangement View. |

## Design Philosophies
1. **Tactile Feedback**: If you touch it, it should make a sound. Sustained previews and interactive pitch shifts ensure you're never guessing what a note sounds like.
2. **Contextual Intelligence**: New tracks and parts should speed you up, not slow you down. They automatically inherit the scale and focus of the current workspace.
3. **Modular but Simple**: The FX graph allows complex modulation (including color-driven parameters), but the core sequencer remains focused on the 16-step grid.
4. **Efficiency Over Clicks**: Broad use of hotkeys (Razor vs Pointer) and multi-note editing (group resizing/octave shifts) to minimize repetitive tasks.
